This repository is for my final project for Water Data Analytics in April 2022. This project explores the relationship between peak snow water equivalent (SWE) and peak discharge on the Animas River near Durango, Colorado. Snowpack is often an indicator of how much water we can expect to see in rivers in the western U.S. This project aims to quantify the relationship between SWE and discharge and flag potential other factors that might affect that relationship for future research.
