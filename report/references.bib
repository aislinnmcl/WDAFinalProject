abstract = {A previous reconstruction back to 800 ce indicated that the
2000–2018 soil moisture deficit in southwestern North
America was exceeded during one megadrought in the
late-1500s. Here, we show that after exceptional drought
severity in 2021, ~19% of which is attributable to anthropogenic climate trends, 2000–2021 was the driest 22-yr period
since at least 800. This drought will very likely persist through
2022, matching the duration of the late-1500s megadrought.}
